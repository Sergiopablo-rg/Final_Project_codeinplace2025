This is the code of a visual representation that compares how different equations of state behave when modeling a petroleum component. I will be plotting variables, such as pressure versus volume, using multiple equations at a specific temperature for comparison. That can give the user valuable insights into how these equations of state predict the behavior of a gas like butane.
